            </p>
            <p>Except as otherwise expressly stated, SHRM is the designated data controller for Personal Information.
                SHRM is based in the United States, with an office 1800 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. The
                SHRM Foundation, Strategic Human Resource Management India Pvt. Ltd. ("SHRM India"), SHRM MEA FZ (Dubai)

            <h2>2. What is Personal Information?</h2>
            <p>This Policy applies to Personal Information collected or used by SHRM in connection with its Services.
                "Personal Information" generally means any information that enables us to identify you, directly or
                indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as your name, identification number, location data,
                online identifier or one or more factors specific to you. Personal Information can include "Sensitive
                Personal Information" (particularly sensitive types of Personal Information) and "Pseudonymised Personal
                Information" (information that does not identify you directly but can be linked to other information
                that doe). Personal Information does not include anonymous information or information that has had the
                identity of an individual permanently removed. Note that privacy laws apply different definitions to
                "Personal Information" in various jurisdictions and contexts, and we may therefore need to apply a
                particular definition in specific circumstances.</p>
            <h2>3. How We Collect Personal Information</h2>
            <p>As described further below, we may receive Personal information through many aspects of our online and
                offline Services, and we may collect such information about you by various means, including:</p>

                <li>From event coordinators, sponsors or other third parties we work with; and</li>

            <h3> Information About Others</h3>
            <p>If you provide us with information regarding another individual (such as a colleague or co-worker), you
                represent that you have their consent to give us their information and to permit us to use the
                information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
            <h3> Information SHRM Receives Through Automated Means</h3>
            <p>When you use online SHRM Services, we receive certain technical information about your use of the
                Services, and that may be associated with your Personal Information in some instances. This “Online User
                Activity” is described further in the next section.</p>
            <h2>5. Online User Activity and Cookies</h2>
            <h3> Site Use Information</h3>
            <p>SHRM collects technical information when an individual visits any online SHRM Services, including IP
                address, browser type and version, time zone settings, browser plug-in types and versions, operating
                system and platform type (e.g., Chrome or Edge on a Windows platform).</p>
            <p>We may also collect information about the visit, including pages and content viewed or searched for, page
                response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information, and
                methods used to browse to or away from the page. SHRM may also receive location information where you
                choose to provide the Services with access to information about your location.</p>
            <p>This technical information can be necessary to provide the Services, and it also helps us determine which
                portions of Services are most popular and which part of the website people have visited. We can also use
                such information to deliver customized content and advertising to users of the Services whose behavior
                indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area, and measure the effectiveness of
                advertisements and web searches. We can collect this information irrespective of whether someone has a
                registered account with SHRM, although some associations may only occur for registered accounts (e.g.,
                members).</p>
            <h3> What Are "Cookies" and How Does SHRM Use Them?</h3>
            <p>In order to collect certain Online User Activity, our Services use “cookies”, pixels, SDKs and other
                commonly-used web technologies. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number
                that is transferred from a website to your computer. This unique number identifies your web browser
                whenever you visit the Services.</p>
            <p>Cookies let us remember your browser so we can provide personalized member services such as My SHRM and
                SHRM search agents. Cookies also allow us to identify SHRM members who are returning to the
                Services.</p>
            <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but if you prefer, you can configure your browser
                to notify you before accepting a cookie, or refuse to accept cookies altogether. While SHRM does not
                require you to use cookies, certain Services may not function properly if your browser refuses
                cookies.</p>
            <p>We may provide certain Personal Information to third parties we engage with for targeted advertising,
                user analytics, and to provide a more personalized experience and special offers to You. Specifically,
                identifying information and Online User Activity may be shared through targeting cookies or other means.
                Please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Opens in new window">Your Privacy
                    Choices</a>&nbsp;page
                for more information about such sharing and to opt-out of such activities. You can opt back in to
                targeting cookies there as well. Our Services also endeavor to process Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)
                signals from web browsers by automatically opting-out website visitors from third party targeting
                cookies on the visited website, although GPC technology is not fully developed and it is not yet
                supported by all browsers.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>6. How We Use Personal Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3> General Use of Information</h3>
            <p>We use Personal Information to operate, evaluate, and improve our Services, including for the following
                purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance of our obligations arising from your membership, Exchange Visitor sponsorship, and any
                    other agreement entered into between you and us, or in the case of SHRM Employer Programs, between

                    interest;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;To respond to your questions and provide related membership or customer services;</li>
                <li>To tailor the content that we display to you in our Services and communications, including member
                    benefits, special offers, advertising and other opportunities and information that we believe may be
                    of interest to you;
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products and
                    features, enhancing our website, improving our products and services, identifying usage trends, and
                    determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns;
                </li>
                <li>To notify you about changes to your membership or related services or to ask you to provide
                    feedback;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>To enable you to partake in a prize draw, competition or complete a survey;</li>
                <li>To administer and protect our business and websites (including troubleshooting, data analysis,
                    testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data);
                </li>
                <li>For those who apply for employment with SHRM, to process your employment application, including
                    background checks and education and employment verification, as applicable;
                </li>
                <li>To comply with all applicable laws, legal processes and industry standards, our policies and our
                    contractual rights;&nbsp;and
                </li>
                <li>For any other purpose specified at the point of collection or as described in your express
                    authorization.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may use and disclose non-personal, non-individual statistics or demographic information in aggregate
                form without restriction.</p>
            <h3> Enhanced Privacy</h3>
            <p>On some occasions SHRM collects Personal Information through its Services with the intent or
                understanding that it will endeavor to maintain a greater degree of privacy for such information than is
                otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;In those relatively rare situations, SHRM will
                expressly disclose at the time of collection what enhanced degree of privacy will be afforded to the
                Personal Information, and SHRM will reasonably apply the enhanced degree of privacy to such information.
                For example, if SHRM conducts a sensitive survey where its intended use of any Personal Information from
                that survey will be more limited than this general Privacy Policy provides, SHRM will specifically
                disclose the stricter privacy terms which will apply to that survey information when it is collected
                from the survey respondent.</p>
            <h2>7. HOW YOU MAY SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>The SHRM Services may also include forums, bulletin boards, discussion lists, and/or moderated chats
                available to SHRM members.&nbsp;<span>Any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information
                    with no expectation of confidentiality</span>, and you should exercise appropriate caution when
                deciding to disclose your Personal Information or post any other information in these area. Although
                users may at times post messages that will appear anonymously on the message boards, SHRM does retain
                records identifying each individual who posted content in these areas.</p>
            <h2>8. HOW WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>SHRM will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent except as
                described below:</p>
            <h3> Third Party Disclosures</h3>
            <p>When you provide Personal Information through the Services for a particular service, product or
                promotion, such as when registering for a SHRM-organized event, SHRM may sell or share certain limited
                information (e.g., title, contact information) derived from such registrations with third parties (e.g.,
                event sponsors), who may contact you directly regarding their products and services;</p>
            <p>When you join or renew membership with SHRM or a SHRM Chapter, your contact information may be shared
                with other SHRM and SHRM Chapter members, such as through directory listings—your SHRM Chapter may
                maintain an independent privacy policy with respect to their handling of Personal Information;</p>
            <p>We may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (ii) when
                we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent harm or financial loss; (iii) in connection with an
                investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity; or (iv) under exigent circumstances
                to protect the personal safety of our staff, other SHRM members, or the public; and</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to transfer the information that we maintain in the event of a contemplated or
                actual sale or transfer of all or a relevant portion of our business or assets. If such an event occurs,
                we will make reasonable efforts to direct the recipient to use your Personal Information in a manner

            <p>This Section is provided specifically for California residents.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Categories of information</span>. In at least the past 12 months, SHRM collected the
                    categories of
                    Personal Information described above in this Policy, including: identifiers (such as name, email
                    address, IP address); commercial information (such as transactions); internet activity (such as

                    sensitive Personal Information (such as account credentials).
                </li>
                <li><span>Financial Incentives</span>. SHRM may offer discounts or other benefits to individuals
                    enrolled in
                    certain subscriptions or programs: Individuals can opt-in to such programs where offered—please
                    refer to such offers for details about each programs’ benefits, terms and conditions, and please
                    note that they are subject to change from time to time. Individuals can always opt-out of these
                    programs.&SHRM does not generally assign monetary value to individuals’ Personal Information,
                    and promotions activity associated with any subscription or program change continually. To the
                    extent California law requires that a value be assigned to such programs, or to the price or service
                    differences they involve, SHRM values the information collected and used under each program as being
                    equal to the value of the discounts or other financial incentives provided in each such program,
                    based upon a practical and good-faith effort to assess, on an aggregate basis for all collected
                    information: (i) the type of information collected in each program (e.g., email address), (ii) the
                    use of such information by us in connection with its marketing activities, (iii) the range of
                    discounts provided (which can depend on each individual’s use of such offers), (iv) the number of
                    total individuals enrolled in the programs, and (v) the products for which the benefits (such as a
                    discount) can apply. These variable factors continue to change over time. This description is

                    individuals
                    (not just SHRM members), including job applicants, current and former employees, contractors and
                    business partners. Job applicants may provide contact information and resume-related information
                    (e.g., past education and experience) as well as complete relevant background checks. Employees
                    receive internal privacy disclosure relevant to them. Contractors and business partners provide
                    business contact information and payment-related information as necessary to facilitate a
                    prospective or actual business relation. Due to the nature of these relationships, the precise
                    collection and use of Personal Information can vary. All such individuals who are California
                    residents can request additional information about our privacy practices with respect to their
                    information, as well as make the access, deletion, correction and opt-out requests described above,
                    by contacting SHRM as directed below. Please provide sufficient information that we can identify
                    you, and be aware that we may employ a more extensive authentication process to verify your identity
                    before responding to your request.

                    there is no standard interpretation or practice for responding to DNT signals (see
                    https://allaboutdnt.com/ for more information), and SHRM therefore handles all user information
                    consistent with this Policy. SHRM does endeavor to support browser GPC signals as discussed above.

            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;<span>Legitimate Bases for Processing</span>: Where required by law, all processing of
                    Personal
                    Information is justified by a legally-recognized basis for processing. In the majority of cases,
                    processing will be justified on one or more of the following bases for processing: (i) The
                    processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (such as if you are a SHRM member,
                    participate in the Visitor Exchange Program, join one of our training programs, or subscribe to our
                    email marketing); (ii) The processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal
                    obligation, such as keeping accounting records; (iii) The processing is in our legitimate interests,
                    which are not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights. Our legitimate interests are to
                    use user data and other information we collect to reasonably and responsibly operate and develop our
                    business activities without abusing any privacy interests or rights of such individuals; and (iv) In
                    some instances, we rely on your consent to our processing (at times as a secondary basis for
                    processing in an abundance of caution).
                </li>
                <li><span>Transfer of Personal Information</span>: If you reside in one of the International
                    Jurisdictions
                    that imposes legal restrictions on the transfer of Personal Information from that jurisdiction to
                    another country (e.g., the US), to the extent that we engage in such a transfer of your Personal
                    Information (a “Cross-Border Transfer”) we will take steps to ensure that such Cross-Border Transfer
                    satisfies known legal requirements. In particular, if we transfer Personal Information across
                    jurisdictions we will rely on available adequacy decisions, derogations and/or data transfer
                    agreements with standard contractual clauses approved by&relevant regulatory authorities to
                    facilitate any transfers with applicable business partners, affiliates and service providers.&nbsp;
                </li>
                <li><span>Exercising You Privacy Rights</span>: Residents of certain International Jurisdictions are
                    entitled
                    to exercise certain rights under privacy laws applicable to their Personal Information. This
                    includes the right to (a) request access to your Personal Information; (b) request that we correct
                    inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you; (c) request that we delete any Personal
                    Information we hold about you; (d) restrict or object (i.e., withdraw consent) to the processing of
                    Personal Information we hold about you in some circumstances; and/or (e) receive any Personal
                    Information we hold about you in a structured and commonly used format. You also have the right to
                    lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority if the processing of your Personal Information
                    infringes applicable law. Please contact us as provided below if you wish to exercise any of your
                    rights, or if you have any inquiries or complaints regarding the processing of your Personal
                    Information.

                restricted to SHRM members only. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session
                to ensure that others cannot access your Personal Information and correspondence, especially if you
                share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet
                cafe.</p>
            <p>We apply a general rule of keeping Personal Information only for as long as required to fulfill the
                purposes for which it was collected including (i) to provide you with our Services, such as to maintain
                account profiles while active and after termination for the purposes described above, and (ii) as
                reasonably as necessary for legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal

                as required.</p>
