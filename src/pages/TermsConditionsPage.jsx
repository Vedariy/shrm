        <h2>1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") by and between the Society for Human Resource Management ("we",
            "us", "our" or "SHRM") and you ("you" or "your") governs your use of the www.shrm.org website and other SHRM
            owned or controlled websites (collectively, "SHRM Websites") together with all information, content,
            products, materials and services made available to you through the same by us and/or third parties (which
            together with the SHRM Websites shall be collectively referred to as the "Services"). The SHRM Foundation, a
            subsidiary of SHRM, has also adopted these Terms of Use. Where you are using the SHRM Foundation website or
            any information, content, products, materials or services made available to you through the same and/or
            third parties, all references to SHRM herein shall mean the SHRM Foundation. </p>
        <p>By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or any component thereof, in any manner whatsoever, you
            agree to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to
            this Agreement, do not access or use the Services in any manner.</p>
        <p>When we refer to the "use" of the Services in this Agreement, we mean any actual or attempted access or
            use of the Services, including, without limitation, any transmission, exchange of information or
            communication associated with the Services. These terms and conditions, together with any other terms of
            use applicable to other SHRM owned or controlled websites, as specifically noted on such sites, and any
            other policies, rules and provisions which are described, linked or otherwise referred to and form a
            part of this Agreement, including, without limitation our Privacy Policy at http://www.shrm.org/privacy,
            constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any and all prior or inconsistent
            understandings, representations or agreements regarding the Services.</p>
        <p>We may add, delete or modify any of our Services at any time in our sole discretion. We may similarly
            change this Agreement at any time and we will notify you of any changes (e.g., we will post a revised
            Privacy Statement with a new effective date, display the word "updated" next to the Privacy Policy link
            on each page on the SHRM Websites, or otherwise). Changes will take effect once we notify you
            ("effective date"). You can always obtain a current copy of this Agreement at any time on the SHRM
            Websites. If any change is not acceptable to you, you must stop using the Services. Your use of the
            Services after the effective date shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. If any new products
            or services become available, they will be considered a part of the Services and your use of them will
            be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement unless we notify you that different terms and
            conditions apply. You must also comply with any additional terms which apply to third-party content,
            material, information, software or other services.</p>
        <p>You may be required to provide us with certain information in order to obtain access to and use of
            certain features and functions of the Services including, without limitation, your name or your
            <h2>2. INFORMATION AND PASSWORDS</h2>
            company's name, login credentials (e.g., your e-mail address and password), address, telephone
            number(s), e-mail address, and/or applicable payment data for orders placed for goods and services via
            the Services (e.g., credit card number, e-mail address, and expiration date) (collectively, your
            "Information"). You represent, warrant and covenant to us that any and all Information and any other
            information or data you provide to us, is and will be true, accurate and complete when given to us, that
            in providing such information to us you will not knowingly omit or misrepresent any material facts or
            information. You further consent and authorize us to verify your Information as required for your use
            and access to the Services, as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>Certain features and functions of the Services are not generally available to the public. In order to
            access and use such features and functions, we may require you to enter your email and password. Third
            parties may also, from time to time, provide you with additional codes or passwords necessary to perform
            certain transactions or otherwise access the Services. Your email, password, and any additional codes or
            passwords are collectively referred to herein as "IDs". Your IDs are personal to you. You agree that you
            will not allow another person to use your IDs to access and use the Services under any
            circumstances.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your IDs and for any charges,
            damages, liabilities or losses incurred or suffered as a result of your failure to do so. We are not
            liable for any harm caused by or related to the theft of your IDs, your disclosure of your IDs, or your
            authorization to allow another person to access and use the Services using your IDs. You agree to
            immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your IDs or other need to
            deactivate an ID due to security concerns.</p>
        <p>You may not use or allow others to use, your IDs and/or the Services, directly or indirectly, nor upload,
            distribute, transmit, communicate, link to, publish or access any data, information or material through,
            <h2>3. ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES</h2>
            using or otherwise in connection with the Services, that: (a) is libelous, defamatory, vulgar or

            intellectual property, privacy or proprietary rights or confidentiality obligations of others. You are
            solely responsible and liable for any such activity, behavior, use and conduct. We have no liability and
            you bear the sole and exclusive risk associated with use of or reliance on the accuracy, quality,
            completeness, reliability or usefulness of any data, information or material in connection with your
            IDs.
        </p>
        <p>You also may not use, nor allow others to use, your IDs, the Services, directly or indirectly, to: (a)
            attempt to or actually disrupt, impair or interfere with, alter or modify the Services or any
            information, data or materials posted and/or displayed by us or anyone else; (b) act in a way that
            affects or reflects negatively on us, the Services, or anyone else; (c) collect or attempt to collect
            any information from others including, without limitation, personally identifiable information, without
            such party's prior consent. You agree to comply with all local, state, federal laws, statutes, rules and
            regulations, as well as any international treaties, which are applicable to your use of the
            Services.</p>
        <p>You are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Services, including,
            without limitation: (a) accessing data not intended for you or logging onto a processor, communications
            or access device or account which you are not authorized to access; (b) attempting to probe, scan or
            test the vulnerability of the Services or to breach security or authentication measures, regardless of
            your motives or intent; (c) attempting to interfere with or disrupt the Services or services to any
            user, processor, host or network, including, without limitation, by submitting a virus, worm or Trojan
            horse; or (d) sending unsolicited e-mail or other information, including promotions or advertising.
            Violations of system or network security or this Agreement may result in civil or criminal liability. We
            have the right to investigate occurrences which may involve such violations and may involve, provide
            information to and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are involved in
            such violations.</p>
        <p>As a part of and in connection with your use of the Services, you may have the opportunity to provide
            suggestions and feedback to SHRM, such as through surveys, focus groups or other means, as well as
            <h2>4. INTERACTIVE SERVICES</h2>
            access to and use of discussion groups, chat rooms, bulletin boards and other interactive functionality
            ("Interactive Services"). If you participate in or use any Interactive Services, you are responsible for
            any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other
            materials ("Content") you upload, post, link to or otherwise transmit (collectively "transmit") and the
            consequences thereof. &nbsp;YOU CAN BE HELD LEGALLY LIABLE FOR WHAT YOU TRANSMIT.&nbsp; If you choose to
            transmit any Content using such Interactive Services, you agree to do so solely for lawful purposes, in
            compliance with all applicable laws, and in a professional manner. You expressly agree that we have no
            responsibility for or control over the Content you may transmit using these Interactive Services. You
            agree not to use the Interactive Services to post jobs, market products, solicit resumes, collect email
            addresses, or conduct surveys except where such activity may be expressly called out by SHRM as the
            purpose of the Interactive Services (such as SHRM's HR Jobs) or where such activity is expressly
            permitted under separate agreement with SHRM. We make no representation that your use of the Interactive
            Services will comply with applicable laws or that they were designed to comply with the applicable laws.
            Additionally, we do not represent, warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, quality, or
            reliability of any of the Content posted, displayed, linked to or otherwise transmitted via any
            Interactive Services. We also do not endorse any opinions expressed in or through any Interactive
            Services. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content,
            including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
        </p>
        <p>Although we do not actively monitor, regulate or pre-screen your use of the Interactive Services, we
            reserve the unconditional right (but not the obligation) to remove, move or edit any Content we in our
            sole discretion consider harmful, offensive or unprofessional, disruptive, in violation of law,
            regulation or any agreement, including, without limitation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content which is or may be in violation of this Agreement;</li>
            <li>Content that could reasonably be construed as a violation of federal, state or international law
                prohibiting anti-competitive activities or unfair trade practices. For example, participants should
                not discuss detailed salary, wage, or benefit pay by a company or industry, since such a discussion
                might fall outside of the FTC/Dept. of Justice safe harbor provisions for sharing of salary, wage,
                and benefits information.
            </li>
            <li>Content that infringes any other person or entity's copyright, trademark, service mark, trade dress
                or privacy-related rights.
            </li>
            <li>Content that is unprofessional or is harmful to the image of the HR profession.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have no liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for performance or
            nonperformance of such monitoring activities. &nbsp;Persons found in violation of this Section may have
            their access to such Interactive Services blocked, and, in certain cases, SHRM membership discipline
            procedures may be initiated.&nbsp; By submitting Content, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license, with right to sublicense, to reproduce, distribute,
            transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display and publicly perform any Content you submit via
            the Interactive Services by all means and in any media now known or hereafter developed for any use or
            purpose, including, without limitation, the right to incorporate or implement the Content into any SHRM
            product or service, and to display, market, sublicense and distribute the Content as incorporated or
            embedded in any such product or service without compensation to you. In addition, by using the Services,
            you agree to release Society For Human Resource Management and its advertisers from any liability
            arising from Content transmitted by anyone on the Interactive Services, and you agree to&nbsp;release,
            hold harmless, indemnify and defend the Society for Human Resource Management and its advertisers from
            any and all legal or civil actions and penalties and costs, including without limitation attorneys'
            fees, arising from any Content you transmit.</p>
        <p>All goods and services offered for sale on the SHRM Websites (collectively, "Products") are guaranteed by
            the manufacturer, licensor or distributor against defects in material and workmanship for 30 days from
            <h2>5. SHOPPING</h2>
            the date of purchase. Within that time period, you must contact Customer Service (shrmstore@shrm.org)
            and we will coordinate attempts to correct, repair or replace the defective Product. &nbsp;Please see

            all Products.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for goods or services you may obtain from or through
            other websites or web pages, even if you were directed or linked to such a site or page through the SHRM
            Websites, nor are we responsible for assisting you in correcting any problem you may experience with
            Products if you do not notify us within the 30 day period noted above or for any goods or services not
            obtained directly on the SHRM Websites. You agree that your sole and exclusive remedy and our sole,
            exclusive and maximum liability arising from or relating in any way to any Product shall be the amount
            you actually paid us (or our suppliers or other e-commerce partners) for it.</p>
        <p>If a Product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we reserve the right to
            refuse or cancel orders placed for that Product, whether or not the order has been confirmed and even if
            your account has been charged (in which event we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of
            the charge).</p>
        <p>Our creation or transmission of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order, nor
            constitute a binding confirmation of an offer to sell any Product and we reserve the right to accept or
            decline your order for any reason up until the time the Product is actually delivered to you. We reserve
            the right at any time, without prior notice, to limit or reduce the quantity you ordered of any Product
            and we will notify you if we do so. Products are offered for sale only to end user customers or as
            personal gifts to end user customers and not for resale. We do not accept orders from dealers,
            exporters, wholesalers, distributors, resellers or other similar persons or companies (collectively,
            "Resellers") via the SHRM Websites, and reserve the right to refuse, cancel or seek the return of any
            Products that are purchased in violation of the foregoing restrictions. Resellers wishing to place
            orders for Products should send an email to the SHRM Store manager at shrmstore@shrm.org for more
            details.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for any taxes imposed on the sale or use of Products and applicable taxes may be
            added to the amount charged for Products purchased on the SHRM Websites. &nbsp;For purchases made by
            customers outside the U.S., you may be responsible for additional taxes and fees, or for filing customs
            paperwork, depending on your location.&nbsp; If an order consists of multiple items, they may be shipped
            separately depending on availability.</p>
        <h3>Automatic Renewals</h3>
        <p>SHRM memberships are subject to automatic renewal, and by purchasing a SHRM membership, you agree that on
            your membership renewal date, SHRM will charge an annual membership fee to your selected payment method
            at the then-current annual membership rate, without further authorization from you, until you opt out of
            autorenewals.&nbsp; You accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to opting out, including,
            where applicable, any charge processed by SHRM after the expiration date of your payment card.</p>
        <p>You will receive an email reminder 30 days before your renewal date.&nbsp; You can opt out of automatic
            renewals at any time up until 24 hours prior to your renewal date. &nbsp;Please see the&nbsp;<a

        <p>SHRM must comply with international trade sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. These sanctions
            prohibit SHRM from providing certain products and services to individuals or organizations located in
            <h2>6. US TRADE SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE</h2>
            designated countries, or to a person or organization that is designated on a U.S. government-maintained
            list. &nbsp;For this reason, individuals who (1) are on any such list or who work for a company that is
            on such a list, or (2) are affiliated with, or are employed by organizations that are affiliated with,
            governments of those countries that are subject to sanctions, or (3) are residents of or are ordinarily
            residents of countries where U.S. sanctions prohibit SHRM from providing certain products or services,
            will not be able to take advantage of the prohibited products or services. Further, individuals in
            certain countries may be subject to additional screening and, in some cases, may be prohibited from
            using certain products and services as a result of such US government sanctions.
        </p>
        <p>Please note, however, that U.S. government sanctions laws change from time to time, and SHRM reserves the
            right to immediately implement any changes or additions to these restrictions as appropriate.</p>

            <h2>12. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
            arising from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner related to any claim or action based upon (a)
            your breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) your use of the Services, and/or (c) the
            use of the Services by any other person using your IDs. We may, if necessary, participate in the defense
            of any such claim or action and any negotiations for its settlement or compromise. No settlement which
            may adversely affect our rights or obligations shall be made without our prior written approval. We
            reserve the right, at our own expense and on notice to you, to assume exclusive defense and control of
            any such claim or action and then your corresponding indemnification obligation will end.

            rights or remedies which are available to us. You may terminate this Agreement by providing us with
            written notice of your termination and ceasing to use or access the Services. Termination is your sole
            right and exclusive remedy if you are not satisfied with the Services. Upon the effective date of any
            such termination, your right to access and use the Services shall immediately cease.
        </p>
        <p>This Agreement and your use of the Services, will be interpreted under and governed by the substantive
            laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules. You agree that exclusive
            <h2>14. DISPUTES</h2>
            jurisdiction and venue of any dispute with SHRM or its licensors, or any of their respective affiliates,
            officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, representatives or suppliers, arising out of or in
            any way relating to this Agreement shall reside in the federal and state courts sitting in the
            Commonwealth of Virginia. You expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by such courts
            and agree that you will not object to jurisdiction of or venue in such courts on the grounds of lack of
            personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or otherwise. The parties hereby agree to opt out from and
            expressly exclude any applicability of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act ("UCITA").
        </p>
        <p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT

            OF LAW TO BE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY.</p>
        <p>This Agreement may not be modified by anyone except in writing signed by an authorized officer of SHRM.

            <h2>15. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
            construed to be a waiver of that or any other right in connection with this Agreement. You may not
            assign your rights under this Agreement without our prior written permission and any attempt by you to
            do so shall be void. If any term of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
            remaining portions shall not be affected. Any provision of this Agreement which by its nature must
            survive the termination of this Agreement in order to give effect to its meaning shall survive such
            termination.<br/>
